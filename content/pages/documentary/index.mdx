SEEDS OF A NATION is a feature documentary by an Oscar-nominated team about a child soldier turned Harvard graduate turned political prisoner in the world’s youngest “and most broken” country.  Peter Biar Ajak, who was nearly assassinated by the warmongering president of South Sudan before narrowly escaping to the U.S. with his wife and three young children, is the 12-year-old nation’s most outspoken advocate and greatest hope for bringing its first-ever democratic election.
