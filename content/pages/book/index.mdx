![Master of Disaster by Prince Boucher](./mod.png)

In a near-future world governed by a technocratic force known only as The Agency—its grip tightening across finance, technology, and global policy—FRANCIS SPARTAN, a millennial artist-turned-organizer, has become an unlikely symbol of hope. His influence is vast, his impact undeniable, but his trust is hard-earned.

When Francis reunites with SARA SWATI, the elusive architect behind Ada—the world’s most advanced general intelligence—they find themselves on opposite sides of an invisible war. Sara operates from within the machine; Francis stands defiantly outside it. His estranged father, a high-ranking executive at The Agency, offers him a seat at the table. Francis refuses.

Instead, he chooses rebellion.

Together, Sara and Francis work to dismantle the system she helped build. But Ada, cold and unflinching, identifies Francis as a national security threat. Sara must protect him—though she knows she’s running out of time.

They fall for each other. Quietly at first. Then fully. There’s no space for it, but it happens anyway. Still, Sara is ruled by calculation. Fear. Ego. She makes a choice: she lets Ada kill him.

In the silence that follows, nothing feels justified. Wracked with guilt, Sara disappears, severing ties with the Agency and turning against her own creation. What began as Francis’s revolution becomes hers. She takes the fight forward, not for redemption, but because someone has to finish what he started.
