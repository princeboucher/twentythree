<li>Question and care about knowing what I'm engaging with</li>
<li>Produced a broadway musical</li>
<li>Produced three EPs</li>
<li>Producing a documentary</li>
<li>Teaching UX & Design Thinking </li>
<li>Writing a YA Tech Thriller</li>

I've got a behavior mindset of leveraging my skills to explore curiousities so I can understand my passions.
