Hi!

I'm Prince Boucher, an applied generalist. I've produced a broadway musical, three EPs with some of my music friends, and am currently in development on a documentary.
As an adjunct professor at La Salle University, I'm teaching User Experience & Design Thinking. I'm also writing Master of Disaster, a sci-fi novella about the conflict of power, ego, and love.
I've mostly used this mindset of levering my skills to explore my curiousities to understand my passions. Let's see how far this thinking gets me.
