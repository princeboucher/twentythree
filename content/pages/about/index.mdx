Hi!

I'm Prince Boucher, an applied generalist. I've produced a broadway musical, three EPs with some of my music friends, and am currently in development on a documentary.
As an adjunct professor at La Salle University, I'm teaching User Experience & Design Thinking. I'm also writing a book named, Master of Disaster.
