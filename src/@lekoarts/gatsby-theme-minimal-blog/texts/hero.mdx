I'm currently:
<li>Organizing a [community tennis club](https://www.missionathletic.club) in San Francisco</li>
<li>Sitting on [Master of Disaster](https://twentythree.gatsbyjs.io/book)</li>
<li>Teaching [User Experience & Design Thinking](https://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/undergraduate/school-of-business/department-of-marketing/marketing/#ftoc-mkt-370-special-topics)</li>
<li>Organizing for progressive movements in California</li>
<li>Advising [climate](https://www.opf.degree), [logistics](https://www.startops.network),[fashion](https://www.earlymajority.com), AR, and AI startups</li>

I’ve spent the past decade moving between technology, media, sports, and public life—less out of strategy, more out of curiosity and a feeling that the world might still be shaped, in small ways, by the work we choose to do. Along the way, I’ve contributed to projects at places like Amazon Web Services, Interscope, Funny or Die, and [United States Digital Response](https://www.usdigitalresponse.com)—though what’s mattered more, usually, has been the people in the room and the questions we asked.

I’ve found community in unlikely places: on public courts in San Francisco, in group chats about climate, in working sessions that ran too long but somehow felt worth it. [Mission Athletic Club](https://www.missionathletic.club), [Global Shapers](https://www.globalshapers.org), Climate Reality, [FWB](https://www.fwb.help), [FORM],(https:www.experienceform.com) Fedtech, [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com)—none of these were just networks to me. They were experiments in belonging. And they taught me that culture is not something you build alone.

I've been featured in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/dating-irl-athletic-clubs-gyms/), [The San Francisco Standard](https://sfstandard.com/2025/04/09/rise-of-the-social-wellness-club-how-sf-turned-sweat-into-a-social-life/), [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/pickleball-tennis-court-reservation-fee-proposed-19462156.php), and [Mission Local](https://missionlocal.org/2025/05/sf-tennis-pickleball-courts-reservation-fees/).
