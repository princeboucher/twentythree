I'm currently doing a couple things:
<li>Writing [Master of Disaster](https://twentythree.gatsbyjs.io/book)</li>
<li>Teaching [User Experience & Design Thinking](https://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/undergraduate/school-of-business/department-of-marketing/marketing/#ftoc-mkt-370-special-topics)</li>
<li>Producing [Seeds of a Nation](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/c6feb172-4ae1-4a0c-8636-b119a5a960ea/seeds-of-a-nation/idfa-forum?filters%5Bruntime%5D=1_45)</li>
<li>Advising [fashion](https://www.earlymajority.com), AR, and web3 startups</li>

As an artist, activist, educator, and technologist I am deeply committed to cultivating experiences at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I've got to work on projects with Amazon Web Services, 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, Unit21, UnitedHealth, and United States Digital Response. In recent years, I have also joined several communities that have helped me grow and develop as an artist, organizer, and entrepreneur, including the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
