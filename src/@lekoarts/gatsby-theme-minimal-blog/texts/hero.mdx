<li>Teaching [User Experience & Design Thinking](https://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/undergraduate/school-of-business/department-of-marketing/marketing/#ftoc-mkt-370-special-topics)</li>
<li>Producing [Seeds of a Nation](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/c6feb172-4ae1-4a0c-8636-b119a5a960ea/seeds-of-a-nation/idfa-forum?filters%5Bruntime%5D=1_45)</li>
<li>Advising [fashion](https://www.earlymajority.com), AR, and web3 startups</li>

I'm committed to cultivating impactful and valuable experiences at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I've got to work with organizations like Amazon Web Services, 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, Unit21, UnitedHealth, and United States Digital Response. Communities have been a driving force in my life and I'm grateful for the experiences with the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, FORM, FWB, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
