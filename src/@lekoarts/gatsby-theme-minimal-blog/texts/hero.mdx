As an artist, activist, technologist, and professor, I am deeply committed to fostering connections between activists, creatives, and technologists at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of organizations, including 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, and UnitedHealth. In recent years, I have also joined several communities that have helped me grow and develop as an artist, organizer, and entrepreneur, including the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
