I'm currently doing a couple things:
<li>Writing Master of Disaster, a tech thriller novella</li>
<li>Teaching User Experience & Design Thinking at La Salle University</li>
<li>Producing Seeds of a Nation, a documentary</li>
<li>Advising startups like Early Majority</li>

As an artist, activist, technologist, and professor, I am deeply committed to fostering connections between activists, creatives, and technologists at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of organizations, including 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, UnitedHealth, and United States Digital Response. In recent years, I have also joined several communities that have helped me grow and develop as an artist, organizer, and entrepreneur, including the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
