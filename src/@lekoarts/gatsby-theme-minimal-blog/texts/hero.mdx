I'm currently doing a couple things:
<li>Writing [Master of Disaster](https://twentythree.gatsbyjs.io/book), a tech thriller novella</li>
<li>Teaching [User Experience & Design Thinking](https://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/undergraduate/school-of-business/department-of-marketing/marketing/#ftoc-mkt-370-special-topics) at La Salle University</li>
<li>Executive Producing [Seeds of a Nation](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/c6feb172-4ae1-4a0c-8636-b119a5a960ea/seeds-of-a-nation/idfa-forum?filters%5Bruntime%5D=1_45), a documentary about Young Global Leader, Peter Ajak</li>
<li>Advising [fashion](https://www.earlymajority.com), AR, and web 3 startups</li>

As an artist, activist, educator, and technologist I am deeply committed to cultivating skills between activists, creatives, and technologists at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I'm fortunate and grateful to have had the opportunity to work with a variety of organizations; including Amazon Web Services, 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, Unit21, UnitedHealth, and United States Digital Response. In recent years, I have also joined several communities that have helped me grow and develop as an artist, organizer, and entrepreneur, including the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
