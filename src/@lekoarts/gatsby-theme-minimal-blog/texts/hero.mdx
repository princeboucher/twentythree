I'm currently doing a couple things:
<li>Writing [Master of Disaster](https://twentythree.gatsbyjs.io/book), a tech thriller novella</li>
<li>Teaching [User Experience & Design Thinking](https://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/undergraduate/school-of-business/department-of-marketing/marketing/#ftoc-mkt-370-special-topics) at La Salle University</li>
<li>Producing [Seeds of a Nation](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/c6feb172-4ae1-4a0c-8636-b119a5a960ea/seeds-of-a-nation/idfa-forum?filters%5Bruntime%5D=1_45), a documentary about Young Global Leader, Peter Ajak</li>
<li>Advising startups like [Early Majority](https://www.earlymajority.com)</li>
<p>

As an artist, activist, technologist, and professor, I am deeply committed to fostering connections between activists, creatives, and technologists at the intersection of civic, media, and technology. Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of organizations, including Amazon Web Services, 300 Entertainment, FORM, Interscope, Funny or Die, Unit21, UnitedHealth, and United States Digital Response. In recent years, I have also joined several communities that have helped me grow and develop as an artist, organizer, and entrepreneur, including the Global Shapers Community, Climate Reality, Fedtech, On Deck, and [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com).
